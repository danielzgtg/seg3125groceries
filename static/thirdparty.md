## Source Code

Not a single line of source code contains material copied off the internet.

The code in the src/ folder of the source repository is completely original.

I used 3+ years of experience from earlier courses, casual exploration, and/or for co-op work terms.
Throughout that time, I memorized parts of W3Schools, MDN, css-tricks, W3C, StackOverflow,
and web framework documentation.

This lab in particular did not require consulting any external sources.
It was done through memory recall and if needed, trial-and-error.
Faster checking was done with Chrome DevTools debugging and Webstorm IntelliSense.

## Assets

Assets are stored at in the res/ folder of the source repository.

This folder contains images and fonts, not code.

None of the work in that folder is mine, expect possibly a minimal amount for the CREDITS.md files.

## Layout

Having used Android and/or Google products for the past 5+ years has greatly shaped my design tastes.
These involve things like fonts, snackbars, input fields, the intentionally limited page width, among other things.

Those sources were not consulted for any specific to this lab.

## Imported technologies

This project indirectly depends on 1736 NPM packages.

None of those are actually required for the substance of the lab.
Removal of them will not negatively affect the lab much.

They are mainly to help ensure cross-browser compatibility and avoid "work on my machine" problems.
Of particular concern is Internet Explorer and Windows.
This is done by Babel, Webpack, TS, PostCSS, core-js and more.

The also provide testing, documentation, organization, and commenting.
This is done by Jest, TS, SASS, EJS, ESLint, and more.

## Output

`main.[...].js`, `main.[...].css` and `index.html` have my code inside.
All other files are third-party.
